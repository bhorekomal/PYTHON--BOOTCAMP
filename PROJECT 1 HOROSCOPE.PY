As the day progresses, you may lose interest in things. Beware of being too sentimental in the evening, warns Ganesha. You will feel loved and generous in social gatherings tonight.")

You, however, are an expert in dividing time between business, home and pleasure. The answer to your prayers is a late-night party, at least that's what you think.")

Statutory warning issued by Ganesha: Don't dive in it, for you may hurt yourself as something or someone is likely to pull the plug, draining out most of the wealth that was amassed overnight. However, you will regain some of that lost money by the end of the day.")

Be good during the day because Ganesha foresees a particularly enjoyable evening in store for you.")

A movie and dinner sounds like a good idea to Ganesha. Enjoy life in all its goodness!")
